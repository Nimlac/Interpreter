# COL
COL Stands for Call-based Object-oriented Language. This is because each statement in COL looks like a function call. For example, hereâ€™s the code of a program that would output "Hello World!":
 
    Sys:println("Hello World!")
 
Each statement is made up of three parts, separated by syntax characters. With this schema each statement boils down to
 
    Host:function(arguments)
 
The host is either a library or an object such as a variable. The function is what to do with that object. The arguments are the parameters that tell that function what exactly to do.
